# Complete code for CaCao and boosted SGG
Here we provide sample code for CaCao boosting SGG dataset in standard setting and open-world setting.
# Enhanced fine-grained predicates for VG
Download the enhanced dataset for VG training, you can use this [Google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WOeumjptstD7nZQJgkJiqbQo9A_05gkh?usp=sharing).
## Running Script Tutorial
```bash
python adaptive_cluster.py # obtain initialized clusters for CaCao
python fine_grained_mapping.py # establish the mapping from open-world boosted data to target predicates for enhancement
```
```bash
python cross_modal_tuning.py # obtain cross-modal prompt tuning models for better predicate boosting
python fine_grained_predicate_boosting.py # enhance the existing SGG dataset with our CaCao model in <pre_trained_visually_prompted_model>
```
## Enhancement Retrain for SGG
	bash train_motif_expand.sh # expand SGG with motif models
	bash train_vctree_expand.sh # expand SGG with vctree models
	bash train_trans_expand.sh # expand SGG with transformer models
  
	# test for CaCao enhanced models
	bash test_expand.sh
## Open-world Predicate SGG Generalization
	# Backbone w/o Epic 
	bash train.sh TRANSGLOVE_novel
	# Epic (+CaCao)
	bash train.sh PROMPT_novel
Complete code and extra benchmark dataset for the scene graph generation with CaCao and Epic will be released with a final version of the paper.
